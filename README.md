## DNS

- [Cloudflare DNS hosting](https://shrinkme.in/s5ct) (Any domain or us.kg, eu.org, js.org, and us.to domains allowed.)
- [Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 DNS](https://shrinkme.in/HhxqdM) (Makes your internet faster and not tracked by your ISP DNS.)
- [deSec](https://shrinkme.in/8BO8n) (Good DNS hosting for free.)
- [Hurricane Electric DNS](https://shrinkme.in/qhys) (Normal DNS hosting with every DNS record even including ALIAS records.)
- [Namecheap Free DNS](https://shrinkme.in/NVFa6jmj) (Simple interface and just normal DNS hosting)
- [NextDNS](https://shrinkme.in/cJSKvD) (Free Forever plan with 300k queries/m and blocklists.)

## Web Hosting

- [Cloudflare Pages](https://shrinkme.in/0sBMuMCV) (Best overall with a free pages.dev domain but has a 500 builds per month limit.)
- [Github Pages](https://shrinkme.in/E1Zhs8) (Free username.github.io domain with a 100GB/m bandwidth limit and 10 builds per hour.)
- [Vercel](https://shrinkme.in/qXcebe) (Free vercel.app domain with 32 builds per hour and a 100GB/m bandwidth limit.)
- [Gitlab Pages](https://shrinkme.in/9l6iH) (Unlimited everything but most complicated and no CDN so you can use Cloudflare CDN to fix that issue.)
- [Netlify](https://shrinkme.in/dezy8F) (Free netlify.app domain with 100GB of bandwidth/m and 300 build minutes/m.)
- [Render](https://shrinkme.in/j2zYgbeV) (100GB/m bandwidth with 500 build minutes/m)

## Domains

- [js.org](https://shrinkme.in/44i4) (Github Pages but with a free js.org domain and Cloudflare DNS support)
- [eu.org](https://shrinkme.in/SexHs) (Free eu.org domain with Cloudflare DNS hosting support but takes a long time to get a eu.org domain approved.)
- [FreeDNS](https://shrinkme.in/C7K0VCzL) (Limited DNS records except for iz.rs and no Cloudflare support except for us.to but that has no NS records.)

## CDNs

- [jsDelivr](https://shrinkme.in/0OS4) (A very good CDN for devs with 4 CDN providers, 3 DNS providers, everything on GitHub, every WordPress plugin, everything on npm, and more.)
- [Statically](https://shrinkme.in/fN04P7) (Has everything on GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket with 3 CDNs on their network with the image CDN feature not working.)
- [Cloudflare CDN](https://shrinkme.in/wwmZdJ) (320 locations with 280Tbps of bandwidth on their network all for free by enabling proxying.)
- [jare.io](https://shrinkme.in/Y1f4UxQ) (You may not use it if your website has traffic over 50GB/m.)
- [cdnjs](https://shrinkme.in/c2G5) (A CDN hosted on Cloudflare with 6,091 libraries.)

- [imgCDN](https://shrinkme.in/B5LwFs) (Free image CDN powered by Cloudflare CDN)

## Email Services

- [Zoho Mail](https://shrinkme.in/GWzkEcb) (I found the Mail free plan for you because it's hard to find and it gives 5GB per user with 5 users with a free custom domain email and a free zohomail.com email.)
- [Tuta](https://shrinkme.in/rJdiGt) (Email service designed for privacy with 1GB of free email storage.)
- [Proton Mail](https://shrinkme.in/792K9h2) (Basically Tuta but half the free storage, more expensive, and if the goverment requests info they will give it.)
- [Temp mail](https://shrinkme.in/fBUo) (A free temporary email that expires after a few days.)
- [Yopmail](https://shrinkme.in/EoZ9qu) (Free temp email with many domains to choose from but the emails auto delete after a week and anyone can access the email you made.)

## Speed Tests

### For internet

- [Speedtest by Ookla](https://shrinkme.in/Itw2Rg) (Most popular and has many servers hosted by ISPs and Hosting Providers.)
- [OpenSpeedTest](https://shrinkme.in/2Dhu4soV) (An open-source speed test server you can self-host designed for testing your local network speed but can also be used instead of Ookla and can be embedded in your website.)
- [Librespeed](https://shrinkme.in/v7LV) (You can also self-host Librespeed and it's a good alternative to OpenSpeedTest if you can't use that.)

### For websites

- [Page Speed Test](https://shrinkme.in/qmwGH) (Owned by Google and shows Performance, Accessibility, SEO, and Best Practices Score.)
- [Bunny CDN latency test](https://shrinkme.in/NucPFQP) (Shows the ping for your website around the world.)
- [jsDelivr Globalping](https://shrinkme.in/MNI8n3) (Also shows the latency of your website around the world with up to 500 pings at one time.)
- [Pingdom Website Speed Test](https://shrinkme.in/DYjR7J0n) (Speed tests your website from the location you choose.)

## SSL

- [SSL for free](https://shrinkme.in/N6ht82Kn) (Not recommended unless you can't use certbot at all.)
- [ZeroSSL](https://shrinkme.in/d7skt) (Same company as SSL for free.)
- [Cloudflare](https://shrinkme.in/nxR3) (Free SSL certificates when you get Cloudflare DNS or Cloudflare Tunnels.)

## VPNs

- [Proton VPN](https://shrinkme.in/f80T) (Overall best for privacy and customization.)
- [Cloudflare WARP](https://shrinkme.in/HhxqdM) (Best for speed and simplicity and really only hides your IP.)
- [TOR Browser](https://shrinkme.in/vAQz) (For maximum privacy and is always used for the dark web.)

## Git

- [GitHub](https://shrinkme.in/E1Zhs8) (Best overall with unlimited storage for free but owned by Microsoft which is known for telemetry, tracking, spyware, e-waste, and Recall WHICH IS A UNSECURED NONSTOP SCREENSHOTING STORAGE WASTING PEICE OF CRAP.)
- [GitLab](https://shrinkme.in/9l6iH) (Best for security but more expensive and less storage unless you self host it.)
- [Codeberg](https://shrinkme.in/l81hO) (Bad web hosting unless it's only for Germany, low repo storage at 750MiB, and you have to request for more resources.)
