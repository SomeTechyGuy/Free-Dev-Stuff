## CDNs

- [jsDelivr](https://shrinkme.in/0OS4) (A very good CDN for devs with 4 CDN providers, 3 DNS providers, everything on GitHub, every WordPress plugin, everything on npm, and more.)

## Email Services

- [Zoho Mail](https://shrinkme.in/GWzkEcb) (I found the Mail free plan for you because it's hard to find and it gives 5GB per user with 5 users with a free custom domain email and a free zohomail.com email.)
- [Tuta](https://shrinkme.in/rJdiGt) (Email service designed for privacy with 1GB of free email storage.)
- [Proton Mail](https://shrinkme.in/792K9h2) (Basically Tuta but half the free storage, more expensive, and if the goverment requests info they will give it.)
- [Temp mail](https://shrinkme.in/fBUo) (A free temporary email that expires after a few days.)

### For internet

## VPNs

- [Proton VPN](https://shrinkme.in/f80T) (Overall best for privacy and customization.)
- [Cloudflare WARP](https://link-center.net/1291423/1111) (Best for speed and simplicity and really only hides your IP.)
- [TOR Browser](https://shrinkme.in/vAQz) (For maximum privacy and is always used for the dark web.)

## Git

- [GitHub](https://shrinkme.in/E1Zhs8) (Best overall with unlimited storage for free but owned by Microsoft which is known for telemetry, tracking, spyware, e-waste and Recall WHICH IS A UNSECURED NONSTOP SCREENSHOTING STORAGE WASTING PEICE OF CRAP.)
- [GitLab](https://shrinkme.in/9l6iH) (Best for security but more expensive and less storage unless you self host it.)
- [Codeberg](https://shrinkme.in/l81hO) (No CDN with servers in Germany, low repo storage at 750MiB and you have to request for more resources.)
